        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M University. I received my Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in June 2023. I also hold a Bachelor of Engineering (2016) from the University of Hong Kong. I study the properties of engineering materials across time and length scales through multiscale modelling approaches, aiming at enhancing and designing engineering materials based on a fundamental understanding of the micromechanical mechanisms. On-going projects include studies on (1) clay and other natural geomaterials to support greener civil engineering construction practice; (2) lunar/mars regoliths in extraterrestrial geologic process and their potential use as infrastructure materials; (3) multiscale characteristics in fluid-solid interactions for hypersonic flights; (4) geomaterials as hydrogen and natural gas storage materials. Overall I am interested in understanding the micro- and meso-scale mechanisms and origins behind the macroscopic mechanical and multiphysical behaviours of porous materials and mesostructured materials in general.</p>
